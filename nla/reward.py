"""Reward = -MSE(critic_fwd(explanation), gold_activation) on L2-normalized
vectors (so MSE = 2(1-cos)). Set NLA_LOG_MSE_REWARD=1 to use -log(MSE) instead;
GRPO-normalisation makes them near-equivalent in practice.

Called from miles.rollout.rm_hub via --custom-rm-path nla.reward.nla_rm.
sglang_rollout.py:255 fires this per-sample as each generation completes.

The forward runs on the CRITIC TRAINER (GPUs 2,3, FSDP-sharded, idle during
generation) via Ray remote — live weights, no duplicate model, no checkpoint
staleness. RolloutManager.set_critic_handles (train.py:26) stashed the Ray
handles on args before any rollout fires.

Async accumulator: collect samples until --nla-reward-batch-size is hit (or a
50ms timeout for the tail), then dispatch one batched critic_fwd to both critic
ranks. Event loop stays free during the forward (asyncio.to_thread around ray.get)
so later groups' SGLang callbacks fire → generation pipelines with reward compute.
